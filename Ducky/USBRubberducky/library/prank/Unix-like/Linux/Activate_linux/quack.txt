REM This project depends on:

libcairo2-dev
libxi-dev
libx11-dev
x11proto-core-dev
x11proto-dev
libxt-dev
libxfixes-dev
libxinerama-dev
libxrandr-dev
libwayland-dev

So unless you add a CVE to gain root and install those thing or the maintainer creates app images of it this one is put on the shelf.
